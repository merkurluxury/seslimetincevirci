Welcome to the Voice to Text Converter!

The Voice to Text Converter is a desktop application that allows you to convert speech into text. With this application, you can either select an audio file or record your voice to convert it into text.

Key Features:

File Selection: Click on the "Select Audio File" button to choose an audio file from your device. Supported file formats include WAV files. Once the file is selected, the application will convert the speech in the file to text.

Voice Recording: Use the "Record Voice" button to record your voice for a duration of 5 seconds. The application will capture the audio and convert it into text.

Microsoft Azure Speech to Text API: The application utilizes the Microsoft Azure Speech to Text API for speech recognition. It sends the audio data to the API and receives the corresponding text result.

Display Text: The converted text will be displayed in the text entry area below. The application clears the previous text before displaying the new result.

User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for file selection and voice recording, along with a text entry area to display the converted text.

Please note that this application requires an internet connection to communicate with the Azure Speech to Text API.
